# Node.js: Design Patterns

13 of the most popular object-oriented design patterns applied to Node.js.

## Installation

The project run with **Node.js**. [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) the Node.js source code or a pre-built installer for your platform

## Usage

Download or clone the repository. Each folder has a working example of a pattern. Access the chosen pattern and run `node index.js`.

### Singleton pattern

> The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.

### Prototype pattern

> Specify the kind of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

### Factory pattern

> Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation it uses to subclasses.

### Builder pattern

> Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

### Adapter pattern

> Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

### Proxy pattern

> Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### Composite pattern

> Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

### Decorator pattern

> Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### Chain of Responsibility pattern

> Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.

### Command pattern

> Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

### Iterator pattern

> Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

### Observer pattern

> Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### Strategy pattern

> Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
